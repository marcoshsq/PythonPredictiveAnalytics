# Rock Paper and Scissors V1.

This is a simple program, import random for the computer logic, and use a few if statements. If you want to add some features, you can put some collor and a little sleep time between the rounds.

##

The script is:

- Create program logic;
- Ask for the user's move;
- Create the scenarios (draw, win and lose).
