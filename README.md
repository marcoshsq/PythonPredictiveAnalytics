## About:

This repository contains the projects and assignments developed during the Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics Specialization, offered by UC San Diego, available on Coursera.

### About the Specialization:

This [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics) contains four courses:

1. [Basic Data Processing and Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-data-processing-visualization-python?specialization=python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics)
2. []()
3. []()
4. []()

Below are links to the directories with the projects and assignments developed, along with a brief description of what has been studied in the course.

## [Course 01]() - Basic Data Processing and Visualization.

    Week 1: Introduction to Data Products
    Week 2: Reading Data in Python
    Week 3: Data Processing in Python
    Week 4: Python Libraries and Toolkits
    Week 5: Final Project
