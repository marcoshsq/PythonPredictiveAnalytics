### About:

This repository contains my projects and assignments developed during the Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics Specialization, offered by UC San Diego, available on Coursera.

### About the Specialization:

This [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics) contains four courses:

1. [Basic Data Processing and Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-data-processing-visualization-python?specialization=python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics)
2. [Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-thinking-predictive-analytics-data-products?specialization=python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics)
3. [Meaningful Predictive Modeling](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meaningful-predictive-modeling?specialization=python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics)
4. [Deploying Machine Learning Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deploying-machine-learning-models?specialization=python-data-products-for-predictive-analytics)

Below are links to the directories with the projects and assignments developed, along with a brief description of what has been studied in the course.

## [Course 01]() - Basic Data Processing and Visualization.

    Week 1: Introduction to Data Products;
    Week 2: Reading Data in Python;
    Week 3: Data Processing in Python;
    Week 4: Python Libraries and Toolkits;
    Week 5: Final Project.
    
This is the first course in the specialization, introducing the basics of reading and manipulating datasets in Python. In this course, what are data products are taught, as well as different Python libraries to perform data retrieval, processing and visualization.

Learning goals: ``Python Libraries``, ``Data Pre-Processing``, ``Data Visualization (DataViz)``, and ``Web Scraping``.

## [Course 02]() - Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products.

    Week 1: Supervised Learning & Regression;
    Week 2: Features;
    Week 3: Classification;
    Week 4: Gradient Descent;
    Week 5: Final Project.

The second course of the specialization, based on the data processing covered in Course 1 and introducing the fundamentals of predictive model design in Python. In this course, we learn the fundamental concepts of statistical learning and methods of building predictive models.

Learning goals: ``Supervised Learning``, ``Features``, ``Classification``, ``Gradient Descent``, ``Regression``.

## [Course 03]() - Meaningful Predictive Modeling.

    Week 1: Diagnostics for Data;
    Week 2: Codebases, Regularization, and Evaluating a Model;
    Week 3: Validation and Pipelines;
    Week 4: Final Project.

The objective of this course is to learn how to develop methods for evaluating the efficiency of Machine Learning models.

Learning goals: ``Data Diagnostics``, ``Pipelines``, ``Evaluating``, ``Regularization``.

## [Course 04]() - Deploying Machine Learning Models.

    Week 1: Introduction to Recommender Systems;
    Week 2: Implementing Recommender Systems;
    Week 3: Deploying Recommender Systems; 
    Week 4: Project - Recommender System;
    Week 5: Capstone Project.

The purpose of this course is to teach about Recommender Systems and also learn about deployment issues for data products.

Learning goals: ``Big Data Products``, ``Recommender Systems``.
