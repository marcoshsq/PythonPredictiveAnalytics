# Pong.

Pong is a classical game, and as simple as its mechanics are, it's a relatively challenging game for a beginner programmer to develop.

You should work with object collision, graphical interface, movement, controls, and if you're feeling daring, you can even add some sounds. It's a really fun project, and it's really nice when you're done and you see everything working. I recommend.

## 

Now, a tip, for every larger project that you'll develop, you'll need to create a "script" or some kind of to do list, so you don't get lost, for this game the script is:

    1. After importing the relevant Libraries (Turtle, Pygame.), 
    you'll first create the game screen;
    
    2. Next, you will need to create the paddles , their positions, shapes and colors. 
    And the functions to move them along with the players command;
    
    3. Now, you will create the ball, add collision, note 
    that the collision goes inside the main game loop;
    
    4. Now, add collision for the borders, and then for the paddles;
    
    5. Finally, you add a score and your game should be ready to go. 
    Now you just add some NFT's and profit.
